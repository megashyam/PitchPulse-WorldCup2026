"""
Shared StatsBomb data utilities used across the football intelligence pipeline.

This module provides the canonical source for:

    StatsBomb Dataset
            |
            |
    ----------------------
    |         |          |
 Producer  Trainer  Indexers
    |         |          |
    ----------------------
            |
      Consistent Features


Core responsibilities:
    - Maintain shared StatsBomb dataset configuration.
    - Normalize event parsing across training and inference pipelines.
    - Provide shot-quality and goalkeeper event classifiers.
    - Handle card extraction from different StatsBomb event schemas.
    - Ensure identical preprocessing logic between ML training and serving.


Design goal:

Centralizing these utilities prevents feature drift between:

    Training Pipeline
            |
            |
     Momentum Model
            |
            |
    Runtime Inference


The module acts as the data contract layer between raw StatsBomb
events and downstream ML systems.
