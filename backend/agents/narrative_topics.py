"""
Redis-backed fixture-aware topic management for the Narrative Hub.

Provides dynamic topic discovery by combining active and recently completed
fixtures into a unified tracking set. Team names are used as detector topics,
while metadata maps each topic back to fixture context for downstream narrative
generation.

Key capabilities:
    - Single Redis SUNION + MGET pipeline for efficient fixture retrieval.
    - Tracks live, upcoming, and recently completed matches.
    - Retains completed fixtures for post-match narrative signals.
    - Provides fixture metadata including status and home/away context.
    - Generates compact match context strings for LLM grounding.

Consumed by narrative detection and generation services to connect real-time
match state with emerging narrative signals.
